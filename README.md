# My Defender

This is a tower defense game developed as part of an EPITECH project, in our **first year**.
We had to develop a game using the CSFML library, in C language.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/my_defender.git`

3. You may need to install the following packages:

4. Compile the game: `make`
5. Run the game: `./my_defender`
